2D Physics Engine in C++ using SFML (Dissertation)

This dissertation summarises the fundamental mechanics necessary to build a simulation demonstrating rigid body dynamics and the forces/constraints subjected to it. Physics is about understanding the world we live in and phenomena experienced every day. The project researches, designs, implements and tests a physics engine to demonstrates these everyday physics. Physics engines are widely used but little is written about the process of developing a simple one from scratch, this project aims to change that. Building on the sparse existing work out there on physics engines; having a literature review outlining the fundamentals is key to this projectâ€™s originality.  

 

The project is structured using the RAD agile design methodology which supports the short time frame and iterative nature of developing a physics engine. The success of the project was not without limitations; mostly testing of the physics engine, which was done visually but extending these tests to gather measurable results is not possible and no results or benchmarks are available for comparison. The result shows that the simple physics engine implemented, with a basic virtual environment can demonstrate physics and its behaviours realistically. One of the most notable aspects is the collision detection and restitution, which uses elastic 2D collisions between spheres to simulate the result of a collision. With this implementation, understanding physics engines should expand on the topic with the hope of more research being put into covering the topic further to identify the effectiveness of techniques and the methods used.
